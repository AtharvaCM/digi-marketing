    "description": "While the UI design focuses on design, details, and overall look, the UX or user experience design is focused on creating an overall feel of the experience within the product. UX design creates products or services aimed at providing meaningful experiences for users. This encompasses function, design, branding, and usability. In short, UX is an entire process that a user goes through while interacting with a service or product. At what point is the user getting introduced to the product or service? Whether it is through blogs, social media campaigns, websites, advertising, or something else? How does the user interact with the brand and what is the experience after the interaction? These all fall within the framework of UX design.Â The ultimate goal to be achieved is that the user should feel that his/her goal is fulfilled."
